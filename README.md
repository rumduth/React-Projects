Hello, I present several React projects I successfully worked on, ranging from beginner to advanced.

1. **Profile Card**

   - **Status**: Done
   - **Difficulty**: 1/5

   This project showcases my ability to create a card displaying my name, picture, and technical expertise.

2. **Pizza Menu**

   - **Status**: Done
   - **Difficulty**: 2/5

   This project showcases my ability to create a restaurant front page that displays several Italian foods.

3. **Date Counter**

   - **Status**: Done
   - **Difficulty**: 2/5
     The program is a simple React application that displays a date and allows the user to adjust this date by changing two variables: step and count. The purpose of the program is to provide an interface where users can increment or decrement these two variables and see the resulting change in the displayed date

4. **Steps**

   - **Status**: Done
   - **Difficulty**: 2/5
     This React application renders a set of steps with messages and allows users to navigate through these steps using buttons

5. **Flash card**

   - **Status**: Done
   - **Difficulty**: 2/5
     In essence, this React application serves as an interactive study aid using flashcards, focusing specifically on React concepts from the questions array. Users can click on each card to reveal answers, helping them learn and reinforce their understanding of React principles.

6. **Date Counter 2**

   - **Status**: Done
   - **Difficulty**: 2/5
     This application is a Date Calculator. It helps users find dates a specific number of days from today, either in the future or past. Users can adjust the step value and count of days, and the date updates in real-time. There is also a reset button to revert to the current date and default settings.
