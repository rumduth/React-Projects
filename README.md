Hello, I present several React projects I successfully worked on, ranging from beginner to advanced.

1. **Profile Card**

   - **Status**: Done
   - **Difficulty**: 1/5

   This project showcases my ability to create a card displaying my name, picture, and technical expertise.

2. **Pizza Menu**

   - **Status**: Done
   - **Difficulty**: 2/5

   This project showcases my ability to create a restaurant front page that displays several Italian foods.

3. **Date Counter**

   - **Status**: Done
   - **Difficulty**: 2/5
     The program is a simple React application that displays a date and allows the user to adjust this date by changing two variables: step and count. The purpose of the program is to provide an interface where users can increment or decrement these two variables and see the resulting change in the displayed date
